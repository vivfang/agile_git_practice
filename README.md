[Google Open Sources ClusterFuzz](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/google-open-sources-clusterfuzz/)

ClusterFuzz is an open source "scalable fuzzing tool that can run on clusters with more than 25,000 machines." Fuzzing is an automated way to test software by inputing a lot of random, sometimes invalid data. It can help developers find crashing bugs, memory leaks, and security problems. ClusterFuzz streamlines the fuzzing, bug reporting, and re-testing processes. According to Google, it has helped detect and report 160,000 bugs in Chrome.


I thought this article was important because large scale testing is an important part of developing software that we don't get exposure to in school. Fuzzing seems like an increasingly popular process of automated testing in software development. Some of us may find it useful in testing our projects for this class or in our future careers. In addition, open source software development is an important skill/process for students and aspiring software engineers to know. This article touches on two important software development processes that many students don't learn in school but will need to know in future software engineering careers.

After reading over this article, I (Justin Cohen) think that open sourcing ClusterFuzz is an extremely positive contribution that Google has made towards software development. Fuzzing and large scale testing is important, and in the past, Google's OSS-Fuzz was only available to open-source projects. ClusterFuzz is now available for everyone to use, and now anyone can use this software to fuzz their projects before they release them. Generous of Google to allow people to use it, and this will certainly improve the software development process for aspiring developers.
